# Rina's Halloween Paintings

46 completely original artworks created by me, using Krita on an Android tablet. 

With 17 artworks originally made for the [All Hallow's Eve 2024 Adventure Map published on PlanetMinecraft by Kimandjax](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/all-hallows-eve-2024-an-adventure-map/), this is an complete collection of Autumn and Halloween-themed paintings to flesh out any world you care to decorate. Released in standard resource pack and datapack formats for greatest flexibility in usage. This version is not animated. This version displays the correct name and artist information in Australian, Canadian, British, New Zealand, and US English languages.

- Resource Only (Replace Mode): Open folder titled RHP Resource Only: Replace Mode.  Download Rinas_Halloween_Paintings_Replace_Mode.zip, add to resource pack folder, and make sure it's higher in the list than any other painting pack. Using languages other than the five above will display Mojang attribution and naming, but this is a cosmetic difference.
- Datapack (Add Mode): Open folder titled RHP Datapack: Add Mode. Download RHP-Datapack.zip and place in your worldsave datapacks folder, download RHP-Resources.zip and place in your standard resource folder. Reload datapacks. Please make sure that one of the languages listed above is somewhere in your language list, even if it is at the bottom.

Trivia: 
- Because the original pack was inspired by [FernGirlMC's pack on PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/halloween-paintings/), the original 17 artworks correspond closely with those. However, they've been shifted around in the pack because I didn't finish in time.
- The black cat I depicted in Void has yellow eyes, like my cat, who is named Butterfly. I'm sure her eyes are smaller than the ones I depicted, though, at least when there are no treats in sight.
